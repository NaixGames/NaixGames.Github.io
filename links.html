I collect useful links for playing games and game development. This is a place to share it. Will be updating when I come acres more interesting sites!

<br>
<br>

<h2><center> Websites </center></h2>

<a href="https://guessthe.game/"> Guess the game </a>. Guess the game presents you with 6 screenshots of a game, and from that you must guess which one it is. New one released everyday. <br>

<a href="https://archipelago.gg/"> Archipelago Multiworld randomizer </a>. Multiworld randomizer is a way of playing different games in a co-op fashion by randomly suffling the items between the games. This site allows to easily get into this way of playing games. <br>

<a href="https://godotengine.org/"> Godot </a>. Godot is a free open-source game engine. If you want to start with game development, it is my best recomendation. <br>

<a href="https://itch.io/"> Itch </a>. This is a site for game developers to freely upload and sell their game and assets. Really good alternative to steam. <br>
