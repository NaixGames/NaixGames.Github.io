I collect useful links for playing games and game development. This is a place to share it. Will be updating when I come acres more interesting sites!

<br>
<br>

<h2><center> Websites </center></h2>

<a href="https://archipelago.gg/"> Archipelago Multiworld randomizer</a>. Multiworld randomizer is a way of playing different games in a co-op fashion by randomly suffling the items between the games. This site allows to easily get into this way of playing games, which is a good accesible way to share your gameplay experience with other people. <br>

<a href="https://github.com/NaixGames/Polycosmos"> Polycosmos</a>. Polycosmos is a mod for the game Hades so it can be used for archipelago multiworld randomizer. I am developing it, so of course I would give it a spotlight! <br>
